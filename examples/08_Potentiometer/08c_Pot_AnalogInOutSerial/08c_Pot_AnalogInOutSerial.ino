/*
  Analog input, analog output, serial output

  Reads an analog input pin, maps the result to a range from 0 to 255 and uses
  the result to set the pulse width modulation (PWM) of an output pin.
  Also prints the results to the Serial Monitor.

  The circuit:
  - potentiometer connected to analog pin 0.
    Center pin of the potentiometer goes to the analog pin.
    side pins of the potentiometer go to +5V and ground
  - LED connected from digital pin 9 to ground through 220 ohm resistor

// These constants won't change. They're used to give names to the pins used:
const int analogInPin = A0;  // Analog input pin that the potentiometer is attached to
const int analogOutPin = 9; // Analog output pin that the LED is attached to

int sensorValue = 0;        // value read from the pot
int outputValue = 0;        // value output to the PWM (analog out)

void setup() {

  Serial.begin(9600);     // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
}

void loop() {
  sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);  // read the analog in value from the portentiometer
  
  outputValue = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);   // map it to the range of the analog out:

  analogWrite(analogOutPin, outputValue);   // change the analog out value 
                                            // aka light up the led with brightness controlled by the potentiometer
  
  // print the results to the Serial Monitor:
  Serial.print("sensor = ");
  Serial.print(sensorValue);
  Serial.print("\t output = ");
  Serial.println(outputValue);

  // wait 2 milliseconds before the next loop for the analog-to-digital
  // converter to settle after the last reading:
  delay(2);
